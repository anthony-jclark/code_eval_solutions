Files:

- `longestLines.cpp` : I refactored this file to allow for easier unit testing.
- `makefile` : This is a simple makefile for creating two executables.
    + `longestlines.out` is the same executable that you were creating before
    + `test_longestlines.out` is the unit testing executable
- `test_longestLines.cpp` this is the unit testing source file
    + I am using the Catch unit testing framework, which I added to your project as a submodule in the extras folder.
    + In the future you should consider writing unit tests for each function.
- `test_longestLines.h` is only used by the unit test file
